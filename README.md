## Developer Notes:
For this project I was tasked with developing a system for managing and tracking employees.

For this project working with MYSQL was completely new so it took some time to get my database set up and write the queries correctly.  After realizing that there was still alot more work to do to write all the functions for each functionality I decided to try to get it done as quick as possible and do everything nesting together.  If I decide to come back to edit this in the future I would like to try to turn these into promise based functions instead of nested functions.
